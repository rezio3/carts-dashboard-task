# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## `Description`

A test application simulating a dashboard in which the user can remove and add shopping carts. Each basket presents a chart with the prices of individual products. Base data is fetched from dummyjson.com api(https://dummyjson.com/docs/carts). The ability to add and remove shopping carts works in the frontend, it only simulates the behavior on the backend side.
